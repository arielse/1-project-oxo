## Attack & Defence
A take on the classic Naughts & Crosses / Tic Tac Toe game.
Programmed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The aim of this project was to successfully create a playable game, based on naughts and crosses.
This I did using JavaScript to create a "board" array that symbolised the tile placement on the front end. Each time a tile is clicked it gets assigned a class (Attack, or Defence) which is then passed through to the array.

After this the array goes through a number of checks to see if any player has won the game, if not the game resumes.
Once one of the players has won the game, by getting three tiles in a row vertically, horizontally or diagonally, the ability to click on tiles is removed.

The option to reset the board is there at any time by clicking the reset button at the bottom of the page.
