Planning For Game Mechanics

- game switches between each user as they take their turns
- game stops when one person wins by getting 3 symbols in a row
- symbol switches between an "O" or "X" depending on whose turn it is
- player clicks on a box to add a symbol to the board
- player clicks on a button to finish their turn
- only one symbol can be inserted into the grid at a time

Code Planning

- array of ["O", "X"]. Every time you click your turn, it switches the array index
- need to keep track of which boxes have what symbol in them
- maybe have to make a loop that checks each box to see what symbol it contains, then run a function to see if a player has won the game yet

- maybe make an array of objects, each object corresponding to a box in the dom. Each has a value that starts at "" and gets a "X" or "O" put into it on player click
- could also do 3 objects in an array, each object corresponds to a row of the board, and has three values in it as above.
